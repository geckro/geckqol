Geck's Various QoL Features is a mod that adds various recipes to help make your playthrough easier.

I realize that there are 800 of these mods already, but I try to make these recipes an alternative to getting them, instead of being a complete replacement.

Some recipes include:
- Recipes for all unique items found in loot chests
- Recipes for extremely rare mob drops
- Recipes for rare fishing drops
- Balanced Ore and Bar Conversion
